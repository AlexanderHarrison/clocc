# Clocc

A simple lines of code counter in C.

Reason why you should not use clocc:
- It is linux only.
- It only supports C, C++, Rust, and Python.
- It doesn't support the latest and hottest counting features.
- It has bad error messages.
- It might crash.
- It might not be 100% accurate.
- It isn't blazingly fast.

Reason why you could use clocc:
- It is simple to build and modify.
- It has quick startup time and a small binary.
- It has good-enough performance.
